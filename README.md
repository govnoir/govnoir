- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gurkwaan
- ðŸ‘€ I've just started out to code and learn the works, my ambition/ goal is to become really really good at it. 
	(and hopefully land a developer job pretty soon, so I can get even better)
	- I have a broad interest in programming, everything from making games to web-design, but not really leaning towards a specific direction yet
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript & C#.
	- I've just started out with git and Github 
	- I'm looking at Angular and Typescript as next technologies  to learn
	
If you have any PROtip for someone new to the game, hit me up!
