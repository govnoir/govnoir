I'm a CS student with focus on AI and a hobby programmer, my ambition/ goal is to become really really good at it. 
	(and hopefully land a developer job pretty soon, so I can get even better)

I have a broad interest in programming, everything from making games to web-design, but not really leaning towards a specific direction yet
My main Language is python, but i've dabbled C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

Always loooking for new fun stuf to learn, so if you have any PROtip for someone new to the game, hit me up!
